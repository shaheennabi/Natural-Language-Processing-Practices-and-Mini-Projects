# Natural-Language-Processing-Practices-and-Mini-Projects
###This repository is focused on experimenting with and implementing various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including:

* NLP Algorithm Implementations: Building NLP algorithms from scratch, such as RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs, and other sequential data models.
  
* Attention Mechanism: Implementing attention mechanisms and related techniques, including research paper implementations from scratch.
  
* Text Processing and Generation: Performing experiments and building projects focused on text preprocessing, text generation, and other NLP tasks.
  
* Mini-Projects: Building small-scale projects that apply NLP techniques in practical contexts.
  
* MLOps Experiments: Developing mini-projects with an emphasis on MLOps, focusing on model reproducibility, deployment, and pipeline automation.
  
 ### This repository will be updated regularly with new experiments, implementations, and mini-projects.
